This is code for querying the
Urban Terror master server for the list of all
urban terror servers. (ip and port)

This is the JAVA branch.  The master branch is Clojure.
There is a SEPARATE repo:
https://github.com/krsanky/go-urt-server-query
That implements similiar goals in Go (golang).
Currently the Go one is the latest and greatest.
